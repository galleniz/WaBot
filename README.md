An open source WhatsApp bot / base for everyone to start with this, based on MizAPI (For Discord) to make the readable more or less cute.

Although there may be bugs since I use Node.js v18 xd.

# NOTE / README / ISSUES
Your WhatsApp number/account will be used to use the bot, so if you have important things keep this in mind.
There are also some errors that don't happen to me, but maybe it does to you, report it to my discord or open a proposal to fix it (my discord: MrNiz#2628).

## Instalation / Setup
- First install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to open the app.

- Use this command to init the project.
```
npm Init
```

- Install the libraries.

```
npm i whatsapp-web.js
npm i qrcode-terminal
npm i cleverbot-free
npm i wtf_wikipedia
```

- And to run the app use:
```
node index.js
```
- And when you finish this, go [here!](#running)

## Running

- When you open the app with the respective command, you will see that this QR code appears:

- You will have to scan it to be able to log in with your WhatsApp account using WhatsAppWeb

Don't worry, just start the app, (NOTE: it won't always appear this way, it will vary depending on how many messages you have)

## Using 
- A example using ```cleverbot-free``` to make a basic AI Chat.

- Or using ```wtf_wikipedia``` to search in the Wikipedia API
